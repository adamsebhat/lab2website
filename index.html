        <h2>About This Site</h2>
        <p>
            So far in Geography 328, I’ve learned about GIS fundamentals, map design, spatial analysis, and data visualization techniques.
            One of the most exciting parts has been working with real-world geographic data to create meaningful maps.
            Moving forward, I look forward to deepening my understanding of advanced spatial analysis and working on more complex projects!
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to Geography 328, my coursework at UW has provided me with hands-on experience in GIS software, Python programming,
            and data visualization tools. This knowledge serves as the foundation for my aspirations to become a data analyst post-graduation.
