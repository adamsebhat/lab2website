        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Adam Sebhat, and I’m a 4th-year undergraduate student at the University of Washington majoring in GIS and Data Science.
            During my time at UW, I’ve taken courses like Geography 328 (GIS), Geography 360 (Principles of Cartography), and CSE 160 (Data Programming).
            These courses have helped me build a strong foundation in geographic information systems, spatial data analysis, and programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academics, I’m passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and look forward to continuing to develop my skills in spatial analysis and GIS applications.
