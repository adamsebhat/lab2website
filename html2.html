        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Adam Sebhat, and I’m a 4th-year undergraduate student at the University of Washington, majoring in GIS and Data Science.
            Throughout my time at UW, I have developed strong skills in data analysis, spatial visualization, and GIS programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope to use my learned skills in data science to enter the field of data analysis after graduation. Specifically, I aim to work
            with tools like Python, R, and GIS software to help organizations make data-driven decisions. My skills in data cleaning, analysis,
            visualization, and storytelling will help me solve complex real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Post-graduation, I look forward to applying these skills to projects in urban planning, environmental analysis, and business intelligence.
            I am passionate about turning raw data into actionable insights to drive positive change.
